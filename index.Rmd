   The spread and the development trend of Netflix are incredible. To understand the trend of development, we start our exploration. To understand the development, we focus on two aspects of movies and TV shows available on Netflix, contents available in different countries and differences between movies and TV shows.

The data set includes details about available movies and TV shows, such as - available country, cast, directors, ratings, release year, categories, etc. For more details about data sets used, please check our data tab.   

  
### **Analysis Plan**
- To understand the data set better, we first obtained basic information of the data set, such as number of movies and TV shows available and number of countries which can access Netflix.        
- To understand What content is available in different countries, we visualized **Number of Movies/TV Shows in Top 20 Countries** and **Top 5 ratings of movies/TV shows in Top 10 Counties** with side-by-side bar plots.  
- To visualize the number of movies/TV shows available globally, we created two interactive world maps showing the total number of TV shows and movies added in each country from 2008 to 2021.  
- To understand whether Netflix have more focus on TV Shows than movies in recent years in different countries, we plot number of movies and TV shows added in top 6 countries from 2008 to 2021.

- The United States is the main force in the production of Netflix TV shows and movies, and the United Kingdom, India, France, Canada, China also have a lot of output.  
- Among top 10 countries, most countries have obviously more movies added than TV shows added. However, this is not truw in Japan and Korea.

Among them, the number of movies generally exceeds that of TV shows.
